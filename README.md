# Hi 👋 I’m Sami Ullah Wani

**Senior Front-End Developer | Angular Specialist | UI/UX Engineer | Generative AI Explorer**

I’m a front-end developer with **5+ years of professional experience** building scalable, high-performance web applications.  
My core strength lies in **Angular-driven architectures**, modern UI engineering, and close collaboration with designers and backend teams to ship reliable, accessible, and maintainable products.

I care deeply about **code quality, performance, and user experience** — and I’m actively integrating **Generative AI** into modern front-end workflows to build smarter, more adaptive applications.

## 🚀 What I Do Best

- Architect **modular, reusable Angular applications** using best practices  
- Translate **Figma / Adobe XD designs** into pixel-perfect, accessible UIs  
- Optimize front-end performance, bundle size, and runtime behavior  
- Build maintainable state flows using **RxJS & NgRx**  
- Collaborate in **Agile/Scrum environments** with cross-functional teams  
- Integrate **Generative AI features** into user-facing applications

## 🤖 Generative AI Experience

I’m actively working with **Generative AI systems** to enhance front-end products and developer workflows:

- Integrating **AI-powered chat & assistant features** into Angular applications  
- Designing UI patterns for **LLM-driven experiences** (chat, suggestions, summaries)  
- Working with **REST APIs & SDKs** for AI model consumption  
- Implementing **prompt-based workflows** for smarter UX personalization  
- Exploring AI-assisted **content generation, form automation, and insights dashboards**  
- Applying AI to improve **developer productivity** (code generation, refactoring, testing ideas)

> My focus is practical AI — not demos — but features that genuinely improve usability and efficiency.
